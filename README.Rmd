# Purpose
Genetic association tests for continuous phenotypes often assume normally distributed residuals. Departures of the residual distribution from normality can lead to an excess of false positives in the absence of a genotypic effect, and loss of power in the presence of a genotypic effect. In the presence of non-normal residuals, the rank based inverse normal transformation (INT) has been applied to improve the normality assumption. `RNOmni` provides an omnibus INT-based association test, synthesizing two approaches found to robustly control the type I error. In simulations, the omnibus test provided valid inference in the absence of a genotypic effect, and provided power comparable to the more powerful of the component methods in the presence of a genotypic effect.
