# Purpose
Genetic association tests for continuous phenotypes often assume normally distributed residuals. When the distribution of phenotypic residuals is skewed or heavy tailed, naive application of methods assuming normality can lead to an excess of false positive associations under the null, and loss of power under the alternative. Rank based inverse normal transformation (INT) has been applied in such cases to mitigate departures from normality. `RNOmni` provides an omnibus INT-based association test, synthesizing two approaches found to robustly control the type I error. In simulations, the omnibus test both provided valid inference, and achieved power comparable to the more powerful of the component methods.
