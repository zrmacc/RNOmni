# Description

Inverse normal transformation (INT) based genetic association testing. These tests are recommend for continuous traits with non-normally distributed residuals. INT-based tests robustly control the type I error in settings where standard linear regression does not, as when the residual distribution exhibits excess skew or kurtosis. Moreover, INT-based tests dominate standard linear regression in terms of power. These tests may be classified into two types. In direct INT (D-INT), the phenotype is itself transformed. In indirect INT (I-INT), phenotypic residuals are transformed. Our omnibus test (O-INT) adaptively combines D-INT and I-INT into a single robust and statistically powerful approach.
